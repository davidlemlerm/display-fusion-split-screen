# Split Screen Function

## For [Display Fusion][df]

This repository houses a simple script I have created to be used in the [Display Fusion][df] software. It will move the currently active window to the left of the current monitor, and move the next window to the right of the current monitor, with each window taking up 50% of the width of the monitor.
